## Exercise - Variables
 
 Declare a variable `schooling` and set it to the number of years of school that you have completed. Print `schooling` to the console.

//:  Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.
schooling += 1
print(schooling)
//:  Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
print("Yes the above code compiles because we have used variable this time instead of constant, using variable guarantees us that we can update the value later in the code whenever we need, whereas same is not true for constant")
